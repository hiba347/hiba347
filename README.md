Hi, Iâ€™m Hiba Akhter!
I am a 5th-year student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, enrolled in a dual degree program for the Bachelors of Arts in Information Technology and Informatics and Masters of Information degree. I also minored in Business Administration during my undergrad. While pursuing my Masters of Information, I completed a concentration in Data Science. I am fascinated by the way technology intersects every part of our life and how it has become such an integral part of any business.
