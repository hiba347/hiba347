Hi, Iâ€™m Hiba Akhter!
I am a 4th-year student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, enrolled in a dual degree program for the Information Technology and Informatics major which allows me to work towards a Masters in Information during my last year of undergrad and finish the Masters degree in one additional year. I am also minoring in Business Administration. I am fascinated by the way technology intersects every part of our life and how it has become such an integral part of any business.
