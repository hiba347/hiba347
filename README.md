Hi, Iâ€™m Hiba Akhter!
I am a recent graduate and two-time Alumnus from Rutgers University-New Brunswick, where I earned my Bachelors of Arts in Information Technology and Informatics and Masters of Information degree with a concentration in Data Science. I also minored in Business Administration during my undergrad. I am fascinated by the way technology intersects every part of our life and how it has become such an integral part of any business. I would love to explore and develop data-based solutions as well as work with database functions and architecture.
